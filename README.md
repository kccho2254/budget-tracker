# budget-tracker
This is a budgeting application that displays in real-time a progression as a chart the plotted points a user has entered as specified numbers. The app showcases in particular the function of a "service worker," a feature allowing real-time data to be displayed on or offline. The app will use the port 3000 on localhost as default, but data will be preserved by the service worker if the connection is halted between the browser and the Node runtime environment shell.
